            "content": "Manual processes cost more due to high labor hours, slower output, and frequent errors, which increases overall operational expense.Automation reduces time, labor cost, and mistakes, allowing the same work to be completed faster and more accurately.ROI is calculated as: ROI = (Manual Cost – Automation Cost) / Automation Cost × 100 to measure how much value automation generates.If automation cost is ₹1,00,000 and it saves ₹60,000/month in manual work, the payback period is less than 2 months and ROI exceeds 300–500%.Overall, automation provides higher efficiency, lower cost, and faster scalability, delivering significant long-term financial and productivity benefits",
